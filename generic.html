									My journey in engineering began at Marist College Yangoji, where I excelled academically and held leadership roles such as Deputy Head Boy and President of the Math Club. Graduating top in my class in science subjects fueled my ambition to delve deeper into the intersection of mechanical, electrical, and computer science disciplines.
									At Afe Babalola University, I pursued a Bachelor of Engineering in Mechatronics Engineering, graduating with an outstanding GPA of 4.97/5.0. During my academic tenure, I immersed myself in diverse fields, including Control Systems, Robotics, Embedded Systems, and Artificial Intelligence. My dedication to excellence earned me accolades and prepared me for real-world challenges in engineering.
									My professional journey includes impactful roles at the Federal Capital Territory Administration and DOT Matrix Engineering Limited. At F.C.T., I played a crucial role in optimizing traffic control systems, contributing to a significant improvement in traffic flow and commuter experience. At DOT Matrix Engineering, I specialized in network infrastructure, electrical systems optimization, and renewable energy solutions, driving efficiency and sustainability initiatives.
									I am passionate about harnessing technology to solve complex problems. My final year project on the development of a Prosthetic Arm using an EMG sensor showcased my ability to merge cutting-edge technology with practical applications to improve lives. I have also led projects in natural language processing and AI, leveraging LangChain and OpenAI API to create innovative solutions in secure communication and data analysis.
									Beyond technical skills, I have a knack for leadership, having led teams in developing firefighting robots and organizing onboarding programs for interns. Fluent in English and French, with proficiency in Python, C++, and MATLAB, I continue to pursue knowledge and certifications in data science and machine learning to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.
